//region Getting nullable values from compound tags

// Implementor's note (leocth):
//
// For checking the types of the tags, the method we use below is theoretically a bit slower
// than the way Minecraft usesâ€”instead of checking a single number, we use the `as?` operator
// which is a bit like an `instanceof` + a cast, which could be a *lot* slower.
//
// However, in absence of performance benchmarks, I think the convenience of using `as?`
// far outweighs any performance benefits comparing numeric NBT types might have.
// I might change our implementation in the future if a substantial performance increase
// can be identified.
